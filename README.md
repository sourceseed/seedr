# Seedr

Seedr helps you to get started quickly. Seedr can setup a project skeleton for 
you in seconds. 

## How does it work

You give `seedr` a seed, that can either be a git repository, a directory or a 
predefined seed name. With information, seedr ask you some more questions and 
build your skeleton project.

If the seed contains a `Seedfile.yml` some more questions will be asked. 
These will customize the skeleton to save you some more time.

## Seeds

 - directory on your local file system
 - git repository (only public at this point)
 - predefined seed, will fetch the seed from `github.com/sourceseed/seed-<NAME>.git`
